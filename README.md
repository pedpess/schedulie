# Schedulie

A playground app that fetches a JSON file and displays the opening hours :clock:. Built with: [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/)

## Getting Started

### 1. Start Mock Backend w/ JSON-Server and Ngrok

```bash
npx json-server --watch server/db.json
npx ngrok http 3000
```

Make sure you run both using the same `port:3000` (that's my default port)

### 2. Copy the Https Address Generated by Ngrok

Ngrok will generate a https address that's similar to this one `https://add72811.ngrok.io`. Use this new address inside of `api.ts` file and assign it to `BASE_URL`.

Without Ngrok, React Native is not able to fetch localhost. Ngrok will create a connection tunnel for us.

### 3. Run Expo Client

```bash
npx expo start
```

A tab in your browser will open and from there your Expo server will be running. After that, you can pick the platform of your choice. The app can run on Android / iOS / Web.
